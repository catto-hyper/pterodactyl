Here is a tutorial to help with the Panel installtion

and then the daemon all it has to do is install basically then u have to set its configuration.

Depending on the OS you are running, you may run into some issues and if you do try running

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JordanEMolina/pterodactyl/master/install-panel.sh && chmod +x install-panel.sh && ./install-panel.sh

If the install does not work, then your OS might be outdated please, try running an update on your OS if, this does not work please contact, a Dev.
